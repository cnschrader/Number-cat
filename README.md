# unit-4-game

In this game, the main object is to match the random number that is generated by clicking the cat images, that have a random number value.

First, the random number the user is trying to reach is generated by creating an array that goes from 19 - 120, and then randomly selecting a number in that array by using math.random. That randomly selected number is displayed dynamically on the web page once the user begins clicking the cat images. 

Once the user begins clicking the cats, there is a number generated in the "my score" area of the page. The cats all have a random number 1 - 12 assigned to them by using math.random. There is an onclick event that makes the numbers assigned to the cats add together and dynamically display in the "my score" area. This number will be randomly generated each time the game restarts. 

If the user is able to exactly match the goal number by clicking the cats and adding the numbers together, an alert will tell the user they won the game, and then the game will reset once they click "ok". If they lose, they are notified of this through an alert, and when they click "ok" the game will reset.
